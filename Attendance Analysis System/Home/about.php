        About This Project
      </h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
      “Attendance Analysis System” is software developed for maintaining the attendance of the student on the daily basis in the collage. It facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. The information is sorted by the operators, which will be provided by the teacher for a particular class. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. Here the staffs, who are handling the subjects, will be responsible to mark the attendance of the students. Each staff will be given with a separate username and password based on the subject they handle. 
An accurate report based on the student attendance is generated here. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. Report of the student's attendance on weekly and monthly basis is generated.
